# React Forms

React Forms library provides a set of tools for [React][] to handle form
rendering and validation.

It provides a **schema language** to define form structure and
validation and a set of **form components** to render schemas into UI.

Data flow between React Forms components provides strong **immutability**
guarantees. Form state accessible from a single location and can be snapshoted
with almost no overhead.

Almost every aspect of React Forms is designed to be **extendable**. It is easy
to customize the behaviour of the existing components or create completely new
ones.

See [documentation][docs] for more information on how to use React Forms.
