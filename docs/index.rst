React Forms
===========

React Forms library provides a set of tools for React_ to handle form rendering
and validation.

The library is designed to be consisted of orthogonal features which can be used
together or separately.

React Forms provides a **schema language** to define form structure and
validation and a set of **form components** to render schemas into UI.

Data flow between React Forms components provides strong **immutability**
guarantees. Form state accessible from a single location and can be snapshotted
with almost no overhead.

Almost every aspect of React Forms is designed to be **extendable**. It is easy
to customize the behaviour of the existing components or create completely new
ones.
